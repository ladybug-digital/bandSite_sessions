            <p>Formed in the summer of 2010, The Wild Ones quickly made a name for themselves
with their high-energy live performances and catchy, hook-laden songs.
Comprised of four friends who met in college, the band - fronted by the dynamic
duo of lead singers/guitarists Jake and Sara - quickly gained a devoted following
on the local music scene.</p>
<p>After releasing a series of well-received EPs, The Wild Ones dropped their debut
full-length album, &ldquo;Breaking Free,&rdquo; in 2015. The record, which featured the hit
singles &ldquo;Runaway&rdquo; and &ldquo;Take Me Higher,&rdquo; was a breakout success and established
the band as one of the most exciting new acts in the industry.</p>
<p>Since then, The Wild Ones have toured relentlessly, playing to packed houses all
over the country and sharing stages with some of the biggest names in music. In
2018, they released their sophomore album, &ldquo;Shine,&rdquo; which spawned the hit singles
&ldquo;Gone&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wild Heart.&rdquo; The band shows no signs of slowing down, and their devoted
fans can&rsquo;t wait to see what they&rsquo;ll do next.</p>
