Verse 1:  
I'm just a small town girl, with big dreams in my head  
I may be shy, but I've got a fire burning deep inside  
I've got a heart that's full of love, and a soul that's full of grace  
I'll chase my dreams, no matter how far I have to chase  

Chorus:  
Cause I'm not just a face in the crowd, I'm a force to be reckoned with  
I'll make my mark, I'll make my sound, I'll be the one that you remember  
I'm not just another number, I'm a story waiting to be told  
So come and listen to me, let me tell you all about me  

Verse 2:  
I've got a passion for music, it's my heart and my soul  
I'll sing my heart out, and let my voice be heard  
I may not be perfect, but I'll give it my all  
I'll take the stage and give it my best shot  

Chorus:  
Cause I'm not just a face in the crowd, I'm a force to be reckoned with  
I'll make my mark, I'll make my sound, I'll be the one that you remember  
I'm not just another number, I'm a story waiting to be told  
So come and listen to me, let me tell you all about me  

Bridge:  
I'll take the road less traveled, and make it my own  
I'll pave the way for others, and show them they're not alone  
I'll be the light in the darkness, the hope in the despair  
I'll be the one that makes a difference, and shows that we all care  

Chorus:  
Cause I'm not just a face in the crowd, I'm a force to be reckoned with  
I'll make my mark, I'll make my sound, I'll be the one that you remember  
I'm not just another number, I'm a story waiting to be told  
So come and listen to me, let me tell you all about me  

Outro:  
So come and listen to me, let me tell you all about me  
Cause I'm not just a face in the crowd, I'm a force to be reckoned with  
I'll make my mark, I'll make my sound, I'll be the one that you remember  
I'm not just another number, I'm a story waiting to be told.
