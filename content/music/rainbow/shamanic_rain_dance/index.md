Verse 1:  
Dancing in the circle, beating drums  
Calling on the spirits, to bring the rains  
Chanting ancient words, under the sun  
Asking for the blessings, for everyone  

Chorus:  
Rain, rain, come down on us  
Bring life to the land, and the crops to trust  
Rain, rain, we need you now  
So come and dance with us, and show us how  

Verse 2:  
Shaking the rattle, and waving the feathers  
Asking the sky, to release the weather  
Jumping and spinning, under the stars  
Praying for the rain, to heal the scars  

Chorus:  
Rain, rain, come down on us  
Bring life to the land, and the crops to trust  
Rain, rain, we need you now  
So come and dance with us, and show us how  

Verse 3:  
Dancing till dawn, under the moon  
Asking for the rain, to come soon  
Feeling the power, of the earth and sky  
Knowing that the rain, will bring new life.  

Chorus:  
Rain, rain, come down on us  
Bring life to the land, and the crops to trust  
Rain, rain, we need you now  
So come and dance with us, and show us how  

Outro:  
Rain, rain, we welcome you  
With open arms, and hearts that are true  
Rain, rain, we give you thanks  
For coming and dancing, with our shamanic chants.
