Verse 1:  
Colors of the rainbow  
Shine so bright and true  
A promise of tomorrow  
In every hue  

Chorus:  
Rainbow, rainbow  
You light up my life  
With your beauty so rare  
You chase away the strife  

Verse 2:  
From the darkest storm  
Comes the brightest rainbo  w
A symbol of hope reborn  
After the rain goes  

Chorus:  
Rainbow, rainbow  
You light up my life  
With your beauty so rare  
You chase away the strife  

Bridge:  
When the sky is grey  
And the world feels cold  
I look to you and know  
That I'll never be alone  

Chorus:  
Rainbow, rainbow  
You light up my life  
With your beauty so rare  
You chase away the strife  

Outro:  
So let's chase the rainbow  
To the other side  
Where the pot of gold awai  ts
And our dreams will come a  live

Rainbow, rainbow  
You light up my life  
With your beauty so rare  
You chase away the strife.
