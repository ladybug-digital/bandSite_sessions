Verse 1:  
Little girl with big brown eyes  
Wandering through the world so wise  
With a heart full of dreams  
And a spirit that beams

You're a force to be reckoned with  
A shining star that never quits  
You're a fighter, you're a winner  
You're the future, little sinner  

Verse 2:  
Little girl, you're growing up  
With the world at your feet, you're in luck  
You're strong, you're brave  
You'll pave the way  

Chorus:  
You're a force to be reckoned with  
A shining star that never quits  
You're a fighter, you're a winner  
You're the future, little sinner  

Bridge:  
Don't let anyone dull your shine  
Believe in yourself, you'll be just fine  
With your head held high, you'll go far  
You're a superstar, little star

You're a force to be reckoned with  
A shining star that never quits  
You're a fighter, you're a winner  
You're the future, little sinner

Little girl, you're on your way  
With the world in the palm of your hand  
You're unstoppable, unbreakable  
You're the future, little angel.
