Verse 1:  
I've been hiding behind a mask  
But I'm just a fraud, just a task  
I've been living a lie  
But now it's time to die  

Chorus:  
Never believe in me  
I'm not who I seem  
I'm just a broken soul  
Lost in my own dream  

Verse 2:  
I've been running from the truth  
But it's catching up to me, like a noose  
I've been living in fear  
But now it's time to hear  

Chorus:  
Never believe in me  
I'm not who I seem  
I'm just a broken soul  
Lost in my own dream  

Bridge:  
I've been searching for redemption  
But it's out of my reach  
I've been searching for love  
But it's just out of my reach  

Chorus:  
Never believe in me  
I'm not who I seem  
I'm just a broken soul  
Lost in my own dream  

Outro:  
I'm sorry for all the pain  
I've caused, I'll never be the same  
Just don't believe in me  
I'm not who I seem to be.
