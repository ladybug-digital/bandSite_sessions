Verse 1:  
Old memories creeping in  
Making my heart ache again  
Pictures on the wall  
Remind me of it all  

Chorus:  
Old memories, they never die  
They keep on haunting me  
I try to run, but they catch up  
Old memories, they're all I see  

Verse 2:  
Time has passed, but it feels like yesterday  
When we were young and wild and free  
Now I'm standing here alone  
With nothing but old memories  

Chorus:  
Old memories, they never die  
They keep on haunting me  
I try to run, but they catch up  
Old memories, they're all I see  

Bridge:  
I wish I could go back in time  
And change the things that made you mine  
But now it's too late  
Old memories are all I have  

Chorus:  
Old memories, they never die  
They keep on haunting me  
I try to run, but they catch up  
Old memories, they're all I see  

Outro:  
I'll hold on to these old memories  
Even if it hurts  
They're all I have  
Old memories of you.
