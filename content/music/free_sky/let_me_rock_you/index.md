Verse 1:  
I see you standing there  
With your head held down  
You're feeling lost and alone  
But I'm here to turn it around  

Chorus:  
Let me rock you, let me hold you tight  
I'll chase away the shadows in the night  
I'll be your shelter, I'll be your guide  
Let me rock you, let me be your ride  

Verse 2:  
You're carrying a heavy load  
But I'll be the one to lighten the load  
I'll be the one to hold your hand  
And lead you to a better land  

Chorus:  
Let me rock you, let me hold you tight  
I'll chase away the shadows in the night  
I'll be your shelter, I'll be your guide  
Let me rock you, let me be your ride  

Bridge:  
I'll be the one to pick you up  
When you're feeling down  
I'll be the one to lift you high  
And turn your frown around  

Chorus:  
Let me rock you, let me hold you tight  
I'll chase away the shadows in the night  
I'll be your shelter, I'll be your guide  
Let me rock you, let me be your ride  

Outro:  
Let me rock you, let me hold you tight  
I'll be here for you day and night  
Just let me rock you, and everything will be alright.
