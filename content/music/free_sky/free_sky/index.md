Verse 1:  
I see the world in a different way  
When I'm looking at the sky so blue  
Everything feels brand new  
With the clouds passing by  

Chorus:  
I'm singing my free skysong  
With the wind in my hair  
I'm flying so high  
I don't have a care  

Verse 2:  
The sun shining down on me  
Makes me feel so alive  
With the world at my feet  
I'll take this chance and fly  

Chorus:  
I'm singing my free skysong  
With the wind in my hair  
I'm flying so high  
I don't have a care  

Bridge:  
I'll keep singing my skysong  
As long as I'm free  
I'll keep reaching for the stars  
And living wild and carefree  

Outro:  
I'll keep singing my skysong  
With the wind in my hair  
I'll keep flying so high  
With the world to share.
