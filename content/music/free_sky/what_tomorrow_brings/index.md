Verse 1:  
I don't know what the future holds  
But I know I'll never be alone  
With every step that I take  
I'll make my own way  

Chorus:  
I'll live for today  
And I'll trust in tomorrow  
I'll take a leap of faith  
And see what tomorrow brings  

Verse 2:  
I'll chase my dreams with all my might  
And I'll shine as bright as the sun  
I'll never let anyone bring me down  
I'll rise above  

Chorus:  
I'll live for today  
And I'll trust in tomorrow  
I'll take a leap of faith  
And see what tomorrow brings  

Bridge:  
I'll take the good with the bad  
And I'll make it through  
I'll make my own luck  
And I'll see it through  

Chorus:  
I'll live for today  
And I'll trust in tomorrow  
I'll take a leap of faith  
And see what tomorrow brings  

Outro:  
I'll make my own way  
And I'll see what tomorrow brings.
