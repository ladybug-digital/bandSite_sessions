Verse 1:  
I'm standing here with nothing left  
My heart is heavy, my soul bereft  
I've lost the love that I once held dear  
And now I'm left with nothing but fear  

Chorus:  
What's left, what's left,  
When all the love is gone  
What's left, what's left,  
When everything is wrong  

Verse 2:  
I try to move on but it's hard to do  
When all I see is what's left of you  
I thought our love was forever strong  
But now it's gone and I feel so alone  

Chorus:  
What's left, what's left,  
When all the love is gone  
What's left, what's left,  
When everything is wrong  

Bridge:  
I try to hold on to the memories  
But they just fade away  
I try to find hope in tomorrow  
But it's hard to see the light of day  

Chorus:  
What's left, what's left,  
When all the love is gone  
What's left, what's left,  
When everything is wrong  

Outro:  
I'll keep on searching for what's left  
In the hope that one day I'll find my rest  
Until then, I'll keep holding on  
To the hope that someday, love will be reborn.
