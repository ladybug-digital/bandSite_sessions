Verse 1:  
Started off with a little white lie  
Thought it wouldn't hurt, thought it would fly by  
But the truth it unraveled, one by one  
And now my whole world's undone  

Chorus:  
Chain of lies, chain of lies  
It's all falling apart  
Chain of lies, chain of lies  
Breaking my heart  

Verse 2:  
I tried to cover it up, but it never worked  
The weight of the deception, it just got worse  
I thought I could keep it all inside  
But the lies just multiplied  

Chorus:  
Chain of lies, chain of lies  
It's all falling apart  
Chain of lies, chain of lies  
Breaking my heart  

Bridge:  
But the truth is, it's too late tonight  
I've lost everything, 'cause of my disguise  
In this chain of lies  

Chorus:  
Chain of lies, chain of lies  
It's all falling apart  
Chain of lies, chain of lies  
Breaking my heart  

Outro:  
I'm trapped in this chain, and it's pulling me down  
I wish I could break free, but I'm just spinning around  
In this chain of lies, I'm losing my mind  
In this chain of lies, I'm leaving behind.
