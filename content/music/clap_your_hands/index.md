Come on everybody let's have some fun  
Clap your hands, clap, clap, clap  
We're gonna dance and sing under the sun  
Clap your hands, clap, clap, clap

Clap your hands, everybody clap your hands  
Let's make some noise and take a stand  
Clap your hands, everybody clap your hands  
Let's show the world we're in command  

Verse 2:  
Let's raise our voices to the sky  
Clap your hands, clap, clap, clap  
We're gonna let our spirits fly  
Clap your hands, clap, clap, clap

Clap your hands, everybody clap your hands  
Let's make some noise and take a stand

Let's come together as one  
And make some noise till the night is done  
We're gonna clap our hands, till the morning comes

Clap your hands, everybody clap your hands  
Let's make some noise and take a stand  
Clap your hands, everybody clap your hands  
Let's show the world we're in command

So come on everybody, let's have some fun  
Clap your hands, clap, clap, clap  
Let's make some noise till the night is done
